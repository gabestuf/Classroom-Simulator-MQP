**JAVA Classroom Simulator Model**

_HOW TO RUN_

1. Create a Project Folder and open it in your IDE of choice.
2. Paste/Replace src & res folders into Project Folder. (In IntelliJ there is also a .idea folder and maybe an 'out' folder)
3. If using Maven or another package manager, make sure to install 'org.json.JSONObject', otherwise use the jar in 'res', explained in step 4.
4. To use the json.jar module in IntelliJ, go to File > Project Structure. On the left you will see Modules under Project Settings. Click '+' to add a module and select JARs or directories. Navigate to the json.jar file, select it and press 'OK'.
